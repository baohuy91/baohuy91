# A Software engineer in Japan
Hi, I'm Huy - A full-stack developer.

I always want to create thing that has good UI and UX.
Both in product for end user & code for developer.
Simple, well structured and tested makes a good UX codebase in my opinion.

## My stack
* Database: MySQL
* Backend: Java with Spring boot
* Frontend: Typescript with React & Redux
* Mobile: Kotlin with Android & ReactiveJava
* Design: Sketch

## Currently, I'm interested in
**Distributed system:**
I'm studying about how to build a scalable system, their patterns, trade-off & best practices.
